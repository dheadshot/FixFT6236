# FixFT6236
These are the files to fix the ft6236 so it can be modified by @turboturbonet's pitft repository

## Usage:
Copy and replace the files in FT6236/ to the equivalent files in your Raspbian build directory.  You can then run @turboturbonet's patch.

## Licence
I don't know what licence to put all this under as I just nicked the files from the appropriate parts of the Raspbian github project.  I guess it's whatever licence they're using.
